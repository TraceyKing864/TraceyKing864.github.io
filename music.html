  <h1>Music</h1>
  <p>I love music and enjoy listening to a wide variety of different things, including basically every genre. Well, except country. We don't talk about country music. I've been playing guitar consistently for 10 years, and have since picked up piano, singing, drums, and bass. Each instrument has something different that they bring to making music and I enjoy learning how to use each instrument for their specialties. One day I'll sit down and actually record some of the music I've written, but for now I'll continue practicing and learning my way around Finale and Ableton.</p>
