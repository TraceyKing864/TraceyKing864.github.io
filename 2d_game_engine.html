  <h1>2D Game Engine</h1>
  <h2>Learned From This Project:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Languages: C++</li>
    <li>Libraries: SDL2</li>
    <li>Tools: XCode, Git</li>
    <li>Concepts: Software Engineering, Systems Design, Object Oriented Programming, Graphics Programming and Rendering, Input Handling, UML Diagrams, Version Control</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is a solo project that I started during the summer of 2017. The project went from June into December. The goal of this project was to get experience programming larger systems than I had programmed in my classes. Additionally, I wanted to get some experience with graphics and input. After some research I decided on the SDL2 library as it would allow me to do graphics, input, sound, as well as some other useful features. Game design is a topic I'm fairly passionate about. So despite the large scope of the project, I stayed motivated throughout.</p>
  <p>There were many design choices from which I had to make and weigh the affects of for the different implementations. With such a large project I tried to stay organized with proper system diagrams. UML Diagrams to be exact. There's a variety of resources online for design patterns and game engine architecture, so I did a lot of research. This resulted in a pattern of research, develop, research, develop, etc. One benefit of having the whole summer for this project, was that I could take my time and implement and try a couple versions of the same system and refactor it to the implementation that I thought worked the best or at least learn from it.</p>
  <p>The end result was a playable, albeit messy, implementation of a game engine that I learned quite a lot from. Working with so many objects and files proved to be difficult at times to differentiate what object performed what and to what extent there were too many objects or not enough. There was a lot of refactoring code throughout the project and towards the end I was introduced to Git, from which I learned how to use the basic features of version control. I plan to work on this project more in the future, but for now I want to work on some other projects of mine.</p>
